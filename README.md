This tool builds a simple web-based RSS or ATOM feed using ASP.NET Core against the public [Microsoft Learn Catalog API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/support/catalog-api). It was originally a live service hosted on Azure, but was removed as people assumed it was an officially supported feed.
